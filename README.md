# MyCamRemote

Control (all) your camera(s) in your Recon Snow2 or Jet HUD

I decided to open my first application to others cameras so I renamed it MyCamRemote.

This app is a Camera Remote clone on Recon Snow2 and Jet Hud. With it, you can preview the camera view, launch the record, change mode, change settings, see the % of battery or just see that your camera is still working.

The communication between the Hud and the camera is made by Wi-fi. You just need to connect you hud's wi-fi to your camera's network name the first time and launch your MyCameraRemote app. For this, go to Settings on your Hud, Advanced / wifi and add your camera(s). You must do this just for the fist time, and each time you change your camera's network name or password.

With this version, you will have :

the Power and select buton 
the Record buton 
the Settings buton (up to 6 presets) 

You can Power On, Power Off, change Mode between camera, photo, burst and timelapse, take movies and photos and preview before record (no preview while recording).

Requirements:

Snow2 or Jet running the latest firmware, 
Works with the GoPro速 Hero[3, 3+ or 4] camera with wi-fi on, so normaly Silver, White and of course Black edition.

I have tested with my Snow2 smith Optics goggles, Recon Jet, a GoPro速 Hero 3 Black Edition, a GoPro速 Hero 4 Black Edition and a GoPro速 Hero 4 Silver Edition.

The refresh of camera's status is made every 3s so be careful of your battery life, the wi-fi consumes a lot, you can change this interval in global app settings. I suggest you 3s, not less.

DON'T LET THE APP WORKING WHILE YOU ARE SKINNG...FOR YOUR SAFETY AND YOUR BATTERY...

I used partial unfinished "GoproJavaAPI" from Adriano Gonella for my project.
